# About the repo

This project allows you to create a folder structure for a fullstack project using typescript, nodejs, javaScript SQL, HTML & CSS

## How It Works

1. Clone the [repo](https://github.com/kennynet66/node_init) in the directory you want to create the template folders by running the command
    `git clone https://github.com/kennynet66/node_init` on your terminal.

2. Change directory to the cloned repository
    `cd node_init`

3. Give execute permissions to the parent script file by running the command:
    `chmod u+x parents.sh`

4. Execute the parent script by running the command:
    `./parents.sh`

5. Access the `tscconfig` files that are created and set the *rootdir* to src and the *outdir* to dist
